This is my first HTML/CSS project made through The Odin Project.
It's also my very first time writing HTML and CSS.
The goal was to create a clone of Google's homepage on a purely visual standpoint.
The links are not functional.
The underscore under the text of the two central buttons is yet to be erased.
